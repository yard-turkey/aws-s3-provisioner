## AWS S3 Provisioner - Access _Existing_ Bucket with OBC Example
This example will walk through the basic steps needed to make an existing S3 bucket visible to Kubernetes and accessible to application pods.
This existing bucket can live in or outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
As is done for new bucket provisioning, a Kubernetes Secret and ConfigMap, which are used by the app pod to access the bucket, are generated by the S3 provisioner.

The S3 provisioner creates a new IAM user, policy, access id and keys for the existing bucket.
It utilizes a Kubernetes [CustomResourceDefinition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
that defines the ObjectBucket (OB) and ObjectBucketClaim (OBC) resources for your cluster. This design
pattern mimics the Kubernetes PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim model.

### Assumptions
This example assumes some familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS and that a Kubernetes
cluster is available to use. This example also breaks the work flow operations into 
two basic use cases; Administrator and Developer/Application Owner.

### Deploy or Run AWS S3 Provisioner on Cluster
**NOTE:** This will be updated with pod/deployment spec when ready, for now
we are documenting the current developer flow.
 
1. Clone this repo and build the binary or copy the binary to the cluster where it needs to run.
```
  # go build -a -o ./bin/awss3provisioner  ./cmd/...
  # scp /bin/awss3provisioner <user>@<kube-cluster-host>:~
```
2. Create the ObjectBucket and ObjectBucketClaim [CustomResourceDefinitions](https://github.com/yard-turkey/lib-bucket-provisioner/blob/master/deploy/customResourceDefinitions.yaml).

3. Run the provisioner (after the CRD's are created) passing in *master* and *kubeconfig* parameters.
```
 # ./awss3provisioner -master https://localhost:6443 -kubeconfig /var/run/kubernetes/admin.kubeconfig -alsologtostderr -v=2

```

### Administrator Creates Secret
This secret will contain the elevated/admin privileges needed by the provisioner
to properly access and create S3 Buckets and IAM users and policies. The AWS Access ID
and AWS Secret Key will be needed for this.

1. Create the Kubernetes Secret for the Provisioner's Owner Access.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: s3-bucket-owner [1]
  namespace: s3-provisioner [2]
type: Opaque
data:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: *base64 encoded value* [3]
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: *base64 encoded value* [4]

```
1. Name of the secret, this will be referenced in StorageClass.
1. Namespace where the Secret will exist.
1. Your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID base64 encoded.
1. Your AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY base64 encoded.

```
 # kubectl create -f creds.yaml
secret/s3-bucket-owner created
```

### Administrator Creates StorageClass
For brownfield, the StorageClass defines the name of the provisioner and the name of the existing bucket. It also includes other properties needed by the target
provisioner, including: the Owner Secret and Namespace, and the AWS Region

1. Create the Kubernetes StorageClass for the Provisioner.
```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: s3-existing-buckets [1]
provisioner: aws-s3.io/bucket [2]
parameters:
  bucketName: my-existing-bucket [3]
  region: us-west-1 [4]
  secretName: s3-bucket-owner [5]
  secretNamespace: s3-provisioner [6]
```
1. Name of the StorageClass, this will be referenced in the User ObjectBucketClaim.
1. Provisioner name
1. Name of the existing bucket
1. AWS Region that the StorageClass will serve
1. Name of the bucket owner Secret created above
1. Namespace for that bucket owner secret

**NOTE:** the storage class's `reclaimPolicy` is ignored for existing buckets.

```
 # kubectl create -f storageclass-brownfield.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/s3-buckets created
```

### User Creates ObjectBucketClaim
An ObjectBucketClaim follows the same concept as a PVC, in that
it is a request for Object Storage, the user doesn't need to
concern him/herself with the underlying storage, just that
they need access to it. The user will work with the cluster/storage
administrator to get the proper StorageClass needed and will
then request access via the OBC.


1. Create the ObjectBucketClaim.
```yaml
apiVersion: objectbucket.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObjectBucketClaim
metadata:
  name: myobc [1]
  namespace: s3-provisioner [2]
spec:
  storageClassName: s3-existing-buckets [3]
```
1. Name of the OBC
1. Namespace of the OBC
1. StorageClass name

**NOTE:** in the OBC here there is no reference to the bucket's name. This is defined in the storage class and is not a concern of the user creating the claim to this bucket.  An OBC does have fields for defining a bucket name for greenfield use only.
```
 # kubectl create -f obc-brownfield.yaml
objectbucketclaim.objectbucket.io/myobc created
```

### Results and Recap
Let's pause for a moment and digest what just happened.
After creating the OBC, and assuming the S3 provisioner is running, we now have
the following Kubernetes resources:
.  a global ObjectBucket (OB) which contains: bucket endpoint info (including region and bucket name), a reference to the OBC, and a reference to the storage class. Unique to S3, the OB also contains the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
Note: there is always a 1:1 relationship between an OBC and an OB.
.  a ConfigMap in the same namespace as the OBC, which contains the same endpoin
t data found in the OB.
.  a Secret in the same namespace as the OBC, which contains the AWS key-pairs n
eeded to access the bucket.

We did *NOT* provision a new bucket, we only created a means of accessing
an existing bucket based on this Brownfield use-case scenario.


*ObjectBucket*
```yaml
 # kubectl get ob obc-s3-provisioner-my-existing-bucket -o yaml
apiVersion: objectbucket.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObjectBucket

      ssl: true
      subRegion: ""

```
1. The AWS Policy created for this user and bucket.
1. The new user generated by the Provisioner to access this existing bucket.
1. The bucket name.
1. The reference to the OBC (not filled in yet).
1. The reference to the StorageClass.


*ConfigMap*
```yaml
 # kubectl get cm myobc -n s3-provisioner -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  BUCKET_HOST: s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com [1]
  BUCKET_NAME: my-existing-bucket [2]
  BUCKET_PORT: "443"
  BUCKET_REGION: us-west-1
  BUCKET_SSL: "true"
  BUCKET_SUBREGION: ""
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-04-01T19:11:38Z"
  finalizers:
  - objectbucket.io/finalizer
  name: my-existing-bucket
  namespace: s3-provisioner
  resourceVersion: "892"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/s3-provisioner/configmaps/my-existing-bucket
  uid: 2edcc58a-aff8-4a29-814a-ffbb6439a9cd
```
1. The AWS S3 host.
1. The name of the existing bucket we are gaining access to.


*Secret*
```yaml
 # kubectl get secret my-existing-bucket -n s3-provisioner -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: *the_new_access_id* [1]
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: *the_new_access_key_value* [2]
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-04-03T15:42:22Z"
  finalizers:
  - objectbucket.io/finalizer
  name: my-existing-bucket
  namespace: s3-provisioner
  resourceVersion: "15058"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/s3-provisioner/secrets/screeley-provb-5
  uid: 225c71a5-9d75-4ccc-b41f-bfe91b272a13
type: Opaque
```
1. The new generated AWS Access Key ID.
1. The new generated AWS Secret Access Key.

What happened in AWS? The first thing we do on any OBC request is
create a new IAM user and generate Access ID and Secret Keys.
This allows us to also better control ACLs. We also create a policy
in IAM which we then attach to the user and bucket.

When the OBC is deleted all of its Kubernetes and AWS resources will also be deleted, which includes:
the generated OB, Secret, ConfigMap, IAM user, and policy.

**NOTE:** The the Storage Class's _reclaimPolicy_ is ignored for brownfield, meaning an existing bucket is not deleted by the provisioner.

### User Creates Pod
Now that we have our bucket and connection/access information, a pod
can be used to access the bucket. This can be done in several different
ways, but the key here is that the provisioner has provided the proper
endpoints and keys to access the bucket. The user then simply references
the keys.

1. Create a Sample Pod to Access the Bucket.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: photo1
  labels:
    name: photo1
spec:
  containers:
  - env:
    - name: BUCKET_NAME [1]
      valueFrom:
            configMapRef:
              name: my-awesome-bucket [2]
              key: BUCKET_NAME [3]
    - name: OBJECT_STORAGE_REGION
      valueFrom:
            configMapRef:
              name: my-awesome-bucket
              key: BUCKET_REGION
    - name: OBJECT_STORAGE_CLUSTER_PORT
      valueFrom:
            configMapRef:
              name: my-awesome-bucket
             key: BUCKET_PORT
    - name: BUCKET_ID [4]
      valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: my-awesome-bucket [5]
              key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID [6]
    - name: BUCKET_PWORD
      valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: my-awesome-bucket
              key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - name: OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_TYPE
      value: "aws"
    image: docker.io/zherman/demo:latest
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: photo1
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3000
      protocol: TCP
```
1. Name of the container's env variable expected to hold the bucket name
1. Name of the config map (same namespace as the OBC)
1. Name of the key in the config map containing the bucket name value.
Same pattern to get the bucket port and region
1. Name of the container's env variable expected to hold the AWS user id
1. Name of the secret (same namespace as the OBC)
1. Name of the key in the secret containing the AWS user

Lastly, expose the pod as a service so you can access the url from a browser. In this example,
I exposed as a LoadBalancer

``` 
  # kubectl expose pod photo1 --type=LoadBalancer --name=photo1
```

To access via a url use the EXTERNAL-IP

```
  # kubectl get svc photo1
  NAME                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)          AGE
  photo1                       LoadBalancer   100.66.124.105   a00c53ccb3c5411e9b6550a7c0e50a2a-2010797808.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   3000:32344/TCP   6d
```

**NOTE:** This is just one example of a Pod that can utilize the bucket information,
there are several ways that these pod applications can be developed and therefore
the method of getting the actual values needed from the Secrets and ConfigMaps
will vary greatly, but the idea remains the same, that the pod consumes the generated
ConfigMap and Secrets from the provisioner.
